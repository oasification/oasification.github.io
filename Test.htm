>The template above is an example of a man made oasis. It consists of about 100, 1 Day grassing areas, each 1 Decare in area. Ruminants and Poultry are housed in portable shelters that are moved late each afternoon. The shelters are called "Decaremobile" meaning Mobile Decare. 
Each Decaremobile has a solar panel roof that tracks the sun throughout daylight hours, this charges batteries to provide power for electric traction motors that move the decaremobile. Water pumps, aircon, lighting and robotic systems are also powered by the batteries, electric vehicles are also periodically charged.
There’s a type of Decaremobile for Ruminants  and a different type for poultry, they differ in that the poultry version has perches, laying boxes and egg handling equipment whereas the Ruminant version may include a milking robot. Of cause the water dispensers are different in each type. Poultry follows 2 or 3 days behind the ruminants to allow time for dung Beatles to do there job before the poultry can destroy them. The template consists of 2 spirals of grass and 2 spirals of forrest. The forest in the spiral areas has oldhamii bamboo, around the outside has some moringa trees and native trees for a wide variety of birds and wildlife such as koala. Underground Water pipes make water available for irrigation and Decaremobiles, every 50 metres along each grass spiral. There’s a 4 wheel drive track along each edge of the grass spirals.</pre><br>
